## **Mini Mall Billing Software System**

### **Project Overview**

The Mini Mall Billing Software System is a comprehensive application designed to automate the process of generating and managing bills for customers in a retail environment. This system helps shopkeepers and businesses efficiently manage sales, track products, and generate invoices for customers in an easy-to-use graphical interface. Built using Python, Tkinter for the GUI, and other libraries like PIL for image handling, this application aims to provide a seamless billing experience for small businesses.

### **Key Features**

1. **Customer Management**:

   * Allows entering customer details such as name, phone number, and email.
   * Automatically generates a unique bill number for each transaction.

2. **Product Categories and Subcategories**:

   * The software offers a selection of product categories like Clothing, Lifestyle, and Mobiles.
   * Each category has a list of subcategories, including specific brands and products.

3. **Product Selection and Pricing**:

   * The system allows the user to select a product from predefined lists.
   * Automatically calculates the total price based on product quantity and price.

4. **Bill Generation**:

   * The application generates a detailed bill showing the customer's name, contact details, purchased products, quantities, and prices.
   * The bill also calculates the subtotal, tax, and total amount.

5. **Bill Storage and Printing**:

   * Bills can be saved as text files for future reference.
   * Provides functionality to print the bill directly from the application.

6. **Search Functionality**:

   * Users can search for a bill by its bill number and view its details.

7. **User-friendly Interface**:

   * A well-structured graphical interface with easy navigation to perform various tasks like adding products to the cart, generating bills, etc.
   * Interactive and clear display of product categories, pricing, and customer details.

8. **Multiple Product Categories**:

   * Categories like Clothing (Pant, Shirt, T-shirt), Lifestyle (Soap, Cream, Oil), and Mobiles (iPhone, Samsung, Xiaomi, etc.) are available for selection.
   * Each product category has a list of subcategories with associated product prices.

### **Technologies Used**

* **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the application.
* **Tkinter**: A standard GUI library in Python used to build the graphical interface.
* **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Used to display images (such as bill templates) in the application.
* **OS**: Used for file operations, such as saving and searching bills.
* **Random**: Used for generating random bill numbers.
* **MessageBox**: Provides popup messages for error handling and user confirmation.

### **How It Works**

1. **Customer Information**: The user enters customer details (name, phone number, email) in the dedicated fields. The bill number is automatically generated for each transaction.

2. **Product Selection**: The user selects the product category (e.g., Clothing, Lifestyle, Mobiles), followed by the subcategory and product name. The price for each product is pre-set based on the category and product.

3. **Cart Management**: The user adds products to the cart by entering the quantity. The system automatically calculates the total price for the selected product based on the quantity.

4. **Bill Generation**: Once the products are added to the cart, the user clicks the "Generate Bill" button, which shows the complete bill, including the subtotal, tax, and total amount.

5. **Saving and Printing Bills**: Users can save the bill as a text file on the system and print it using the integrated print functionality.

6. **Search and Retrieve Bills**: The user can search for any previously saved bills using the bill number.

### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/billing-software.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install tkinter pillow
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   After setting up the project, you can run the `bill_app.py` file:

   ```bash
   python bill_app.py
   ```

### **Screenshots**

* **Main Interface**: Displays product categories, customer details, and bill generation options.
* **Bill Generation**: Displays the generated bill with all the relevant details.
* **Customer and Product Management**: Allows input of customer details and selection of products.

### **Future Enhancements**

* **Database Integration**: Implementing a database (such as SQLite) to store product data and sales history.
* **User Authentication**: Adding user login functionality to restrict access to certain features.
* **Multi-Language Support**: Adding support for multiple languages for wider accessibility.
* **Discounts and Offers**: Implementing a discount system where customers can apply promotional codes.
* **Inventory Management**: Keeping track of stock levels for each product and alerting when inventory is low.
